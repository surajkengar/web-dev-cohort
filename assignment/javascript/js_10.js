// string templete in javascript
let age = 23;
let name = "suraj";

//suppse we want a print text like my name is suraj and my age 23
// generally this do - "my name is "+ name +"and my age is "+ age;
// but by using string template we can easily do this easily without doing this stuff

let aboutme = `my name is ${name} and my age is ${age}`;
console.log(aboutme);

//  whenever we use templet string there is need to be write the text in a backtiks ` ` .
